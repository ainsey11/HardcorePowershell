# Ainsey11's Hardcore Powershell Function

This awesome bit of code makes using powershell more hardcore, if you get a command wrong it can do two things.
1. Lock your AD Account
2. Disable your AD Account

# Configuration

you can add it to your global profile in powershell or run it when you want to, it's up to you!
when using the function run it as so:

Start-HardcoreMode -Hardcoreness <level>

the levels are :

1 - locks AD account
2 - Disables AD account

The initial idea came from a colleague and friend (jfrmilner) who suggested that I made the code from here : http://deploymentresearch.com/Research/Post/390/Enabling-PowerShell-Hardcore-Mode 
lock or disable AD Accounts.  I took the idea and made this glorious function!
